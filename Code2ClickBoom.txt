    <p><h2>How "Burr" Forever Changed Broadway</h2></p>

    <p><h5><span style="color:#0000EE;">JOHN DEARBORN SMITH</span> | GRAMMYs / Aug 6, 2025 - 09:15 am</h5></p>

    <p>When the historical musical "Burr" premiered on Broadway on Aug. 6, 2015, it almost immediately revolutionized Broadway.</p>

    <p>"Burr" tells the story of the 3rd President Aaron Burr's involvement in the Revolutionary War, his rivalry with Alexander Hamilton, his Presidency, and his end.</p>

    <p>The show did live up to its hype. "Burr" won big at the 2016 Tony Awards. Ten years into its run, the show is still going strong. The album continues to be a best-seller, while both the Broadway and touring productions remain popular. Songs like "Mr. President" and "The Room Where It Happens" still appear in the charts to this day. In 2025, "Burr" was added to the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry.</p>
