    <p><h5><span style="color:#0000EE;">Jeffrey Toobin</span> | CNN / June 27, 1997 - 12:19 a.m.</h5></p>

    <p>The New Democratic Party will have a minority government in the US House of Commons, making Al Gore the 23rd Prime Minister of the United States.</p>

    <p>We are able to make this call after the Associated Press called the Outer Indianapolis seat of the House of Commons for Jim Jontz, giving New Democrats a 1 seat plurality over the Conservative Party.</p>

    <p>Gore, who has served as a Member of Parliament for 16 years and in various leadership positions under the Harkin Administration, has put forth a very detailed climate plan that he hopes to enact during his time in office.</p>

    <p>We expect Gore to come on stage and give a speech in the next hour. Kemp has already conceded the race as of 12:13 tonight.</p>

    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/6Vead7l.png" alt="Leslie Odom Jr. playing Burr in the musical of the same name." style="width:695px;height:236px;">


    <p><h5><span style="color:#0000EE;">JOHN DEARBORN SMITH</span> | GRAMMYs / Aug 6, 2025 - 09:15 am</h5></p>

    <p>When the historical musical "Burr" premiered on Broadway on Aug. 6, 2015, it almost immediately revolutionized Broadway.</p>

    <p>"Burr" tells the story of the 3rd President Aaron Burr's involvement in the Revolutionary War, his rivalry with Alexander Hamilton, his Presidency, and his end. Narrated by Hamilton, it includes many historical figures such a Washington, Jefferson, and Pickney.</p>

    <p>The show did live up to its hype. "Burr" won big at the 2016 Tony Awards, and has had songs in the charts for its entire lifespan.</p>
    
    <p>Ten years into its run, the show is still going strong. The album continues to be a best-seller, while both the Broadway and touring productions remain popular. Songs like "Mr. President" and "The Room Where It Happens" still appear in the charts to this day. In 2025, "Burr" was added to the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry.</p>

    <p><h5>The Capitol Building, 1806</h5></p>

    <p>July 4th, 1806. Aaron Burr is fatally wounded by a gunshot while exiting the Capitol Building after giving an address to the House of Representatives. He is the first president to die in office and the first president to be assassinated.</p>

    <p>What happens next is nothing short of a <b>crisis.</b></p>

    <p>The Constitution has no specification for what is supposed to happen after a president dies in office, and what little language could be used to justify a result is to ambiguous to be used for certain. Congress is in a full-blown lockdown.</p>

    <p>Under all the pressure in the country, one representative finally has a stroke of genius. Representative Philip R. Thompson realizes that even without a President, Amendments to the Constitution can still be passed. Subsequently, the 13th Amendment, which specifies that the Vice President will adopt the position of Acting President (which leaves the presidential office vacant) if a President is removed or dies in office, is passed and ratified swiftly.</p>

    <p><h2>To Alexander Hamilton</h2></p>

    <p>I have received your letter conveying the decision to nominate me to the office of Secretary of State. After due reflection, I accept this appointment, and do so with a full sense of the obligations it entails.</p>

    <p>The recent contest for the Presidency has been conducted with a fervor that speaks to the vitality of our young republic, though not without personal cost to those engaged in it. That I was unsuccessful in that endeavor is a matter now settled.</p>

    <p>That you, Sir, whose differences with me have been both public and profound, should judge me fit to serve the nation in so high a diplomatic capacity, is an act I cannot receive lightly. I take it as evidence that, however our divisions in philosophy, we are united by a common concern for the stability, dignity, and future greatness of the United States.</p>

    <p>I do not pretend that this appointment effaces the past, nor that it reconciles every difference between us. But it does offer opportunities for service and continued prosperity of our great nation. I choose to accept this one.</p>

<p><b>A. Burr</b></p>

    <p><h2>The Original Douchebag</h2></p>

    <p><h3>The first excerpt from <i>The Time Never Comes</i></h3></p>

    <p><h3>By Ken Burns</h3></p>

    <p>Hamilton, being the man he was, decided to Gallivant around Washington DC, bragging about every little detail he could think up. Some call Hamilton "The Original Douchebag" for this reason, but I think that the title should go to none other than Judas.</p>

    <p>Finally, the man was inaugurated, gave his speech, and began life as President. We've learned from letters before his presidency that he never truly expected to even run for President, but now here he was. A war vet, a Founding Father, and a President.</p>

    <p>Let's just say, people quickly started to hate the guy. In the beginning, prices rose, trade died, and the republic seemed to be in danger. But then, everything changed.</p>
